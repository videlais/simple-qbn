<h2 id="term">Term</h2>

<p>On the Dragon’s Lair Project’s (DLP) website created by Kinder and Hallock (1997), there is a breakdown of scenes from <em>Dragon’s Lair</em> (1983) as well as some notes about when they appear. This includes an introduction of some terms used by Kinder and Hallock (1997) to discuss <em>Dragon’s Lair</em> (1983): <em>scenes</em>, <em>cycles</em>, and the <em>conditions</em> in which scenes become part of <em>cycles</em>.</p>

<p>“There are three cycles in a full game,” starts the breakdown. A <em>scene</em> is chosen at random from a set, and then each progressive scene is chosen from the next set in order at random. However, Kinder and Hallock (1997) also note something else:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The scenes that a player dies on are queued, (an unlimited lives game queues a maximum of 8 scenes for each player), and these scenes are replayed later, immediately after the third cycle, before entering the dragon’s lair (29).</p>

  <p>- Kinder and Hallock (1997)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on these descriptions, there are several major concepts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Scene</strong>: interactive content</li>
  <li><strong>Set</strong>: collection of three <em>scenes</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Cycle</strong>: progression of <em>scenes</em> chosen at random from those remaining from each <em>set</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Conditions</strong>: If a death occurs during a scene, it is queued for play after the last <em>cycle</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first cycle of <em>Dragon’s Lair</em> (1983) always includes 12 <em>scenes</em> and ends with <em>scene</em> 7A (Kinder and Hallock, 1997). The second <em>cycle</em> then starts and a <em>scene</em> is selected from those remaining from each <em>set</em>, ending with <em>scene</em> 7B. In the final, third <em>cycle</em>, the remaining <em>scene</em> from each <em>set</em> is used. As explained by Kinder and Hallock (1997), a fourth <em>cycle</em> is created from any <em>scenes</em> where character death occurred after the third <em>cycle</em>.</p>
