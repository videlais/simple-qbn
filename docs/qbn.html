<h2 id="term">Term</h2>

<p>In the same blog post defining <a href="./storylet.md">storylet</a>, Failbetter Games (2010) also describes the use of <em>qualities</em> as something that “tell storylets what to do” (para. 4; original emphasis). In this definition, <em>qualities</em> exist as a form of conditional statements. For example, the player may need 4 Jade and to be at a location named Edge City to access a storylet. The condition <code class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="mi">4</span> <span class="nx">Jade</span> <span class="nx">AND</span> <span class="nx">location</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="err">‘</span><span class="nx">Edge</span> <span class="nx">City</span><span class="dl">'</span></code> exists as a combination <em>quality</em> for a particular storylet.</p>

<p>A <em>quality-based narrative</em> (QBN) is one where storylet selection is based based on its <em>qualities</em> (prerequisites).</p>

<h2 id="historical-usage">Historical Usage</h2>

<p><em>King of Dragon Pass</em> (1999) has been cited by Failbetter Games (2011) as an inspiration for <em>Fallen London</em> (2009).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every other turn or so, you are confronted by an event like this: a slice of story and a set of responses, like an Echo Bazaar storylet. The art is beautiful. The text is clean and urgent, deftly distilling conflict into a single gripping decision. Each choice has its consequences and can trigger follow-up events, with some stories unfolding over decades of play.</p>

  <p>Echo Bazaar Inspirations: King of Dragon Pass. Failbetter Games (2011), Para 4.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In <em>King of Dragon Pass</em> (1999), play proceeds across different decision points. Presented as small vignettes, the player must pick from a small set of choices affecting different in-world plot events and the current resources of a tribe. These vignettes are selected based on a combination of three factors: previous decisions made by the player, the current resources of their tribe, and a degree of randomness. Within the game, there is a pool of hundreds of possible vignettes, making every trip through the game unique.</p>

<p>In developing <em>King of Dragon Pass</em> (1999), A Sharp, created a scripting language called Opal Scripting Language (OSL). In this language, different vignettes were locked behind certain conditions like <code class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><span class="nx">dragonAttitude</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">positive</span><span class="dl">'</span></code> (OSL Sample, 2020). These act as its <em>qualities</em> as shown below:</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>text: &lt;he/she&gt; gives away clan wealth to those fiendish talking lizards.
[n AND dragonAttitude= 'positive] text: Despite &lt;his/her&gt; assurance, &lt;he/she&gt; has done little to help our case with the dragonewts.
[n AND dragonAttitude= 'neutral] text: &lt;he/she&gt; wastes time thinking about talking lizards, instead of clan concerns.
[a] text: &lt;he/she&gt; sends our weaponthanes into the woods on pointless hunts for the plant-folk.
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="alternative-terms">Alternative Terms</h2>

<p>While many people have embraced the term quality-based narrative based on Failbetter Games and Emily Short’s work, Kennedy (2017), co-creator of the term, has proposed “resource narratives” or resource-based narrative (RBN) as alternatives because of the issue around a potential misunderstanding of “quality” applying not to measurements of a storylet’s prerequisite but its content (para. 3). As the term “resource” is used in StoryNexus’ documentation to discuss qualities as currency, such a usage has gained some interest (Storychoices, 2012).</p>

<p>The term salience-based narrative (SBN) has also been proposed by Short (2016) to describe a system using a drama manager like used in <em>Façade</em> (2005) to use salience to limit the current options or choices of the player (Mateas and Stern, 2005). Kreminski and Wardrip-Fruin (2018) have also proposed weights for storylets or the use of a system to manage storylet tracking.</p>
