<h2 id="term">Term</h2>

<p>In a blog post now only available from the Internet Archive, Doug Sharp (1989) describes the “battle” of interactive fiction from a GDC 1989 talk on the same topic. Within the post, Sharp (1989) mentions a project called <em>King of Chicago</em> (1989) and how it is an “honorable failure.” Toward the end of the post, Sharp (1989) writes about a design of a “big bags with smaller bags inside which hold clips, which I called episodes.” Each one of these <em>episodes</em> would:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>specif[y] things like who is to be onscreen, chooses background graphics, switches between close-ups and medium shots, drives the character’s animation and facial expression, and feeds dialog to them. The episode script reads a lot like a playscript or screenplay. A single episode might put Pinky and his girlfriend Lola in her bedroom, and have her badger Pinky about earning more money. This episode might take two minutes of screen time.</p>

  <p>- Sharp (1989)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the following paragraphs, Sharp (1989) relates the interface between the <em>state</em> (collection of values) and how it affects episode navigation. As Sharp (1989) writes it: “The episode selector looks at all the keys of available episodes and selects the one that most closely matches current game variables. Its method is to look for a least square fit.”</p>

<p>In pulling from the model Sharp (1989) writes about, there are several major concepts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Story</strong>: Multiple episodes, each govern by character</li>
  <li><strong>Episode</strong>: Selection of sequences influenced by player actions within rules of player interactions</li>
  <li><strong>Narrator</strong>: decides episode order and when each ends</li>
  <li><strong>Sequences</strong>: set of phases (act-like structure within an episode)</li>
  <li><strong>Actions</strong>: player input</li>
</ul>

<p>A <em>story</em> starts with an <em>episode</em>, composed of <em>sequences</em>. The player takes <em>actions</em>, which changes the values watched by the <em>Narrator</em>. This affects which <em>sequences</em> are chosen next, if the episode ends, and any future changes carried over into future episodes. When the episodes are exhausted, play ends.</p>
