# Scenes and Cycles (1983)

## Term

On the Dragon’s Lair Project’s (DLP) website created by Kinder and Hallock (1997), there is a breakdown of scenes from *Dragon’s Lair* (1983) as well as some notes about when they appear. This includes an introduction of some terms used by Kinder and Hallock (1997) to discuss *Dragon’s Lair* (1983): *scenes*, *cycles*, and the *conditions* in which scenes become part of *cycles*.

"There are three cycles in a full game," starts the breakdown. A *scene* is chosen at random from a set, and then each progressive scene is chosen from the next set in order at random. However, Kinder and Hallock (1997) also note something else:

> The scenes that a player dies on are queued, (an unlimited lives game queues a maximum of 8 scenes for each player), and these scenes are replayed later, immediately after the third cycle, before entering the dragon’s lair (29).
>
> \- Kinder and Hallock (1997)

Based on these descriptions, there are several major concepts:

* **Scene**: interactive content
* **Set**: collection of three *scenes*.
* **Cycle**: progression of *scenes* chosen at random from those remaining from each *set*.
* **Conditions**: If a death occurs during a scene, it is queued for play after the last *cycle*.

The first cycle of *Dragon’s Lair* (1983) always includes 12 *scenes* and ends with *scene* 7A (Kinder and Hallock, 1997). The second *cycle* then starts and a *scene* is selected from those remaining from each *set*, ending with *scene* 7B. In the final, third *cycle*, the remaining *scene* from each *set* is used. As explained by Kinder and Hallock (1997), a fourth *cycle* is created from any *scenes* where character death occurred after the third *cycle*.
